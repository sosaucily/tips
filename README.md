tips
====
This is the take-home exercise for the CodePath ios class starting sep 10, 2014.

This is a basic tip calculating app.  How fun!

I've used a modal transition to open the settings ViewController, called SettingsViewController, which implements a TableView element to manage the default tip amount.
